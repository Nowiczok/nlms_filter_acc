2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock bram_clk_a is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks bram_clk_a and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks bram_clk_a] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and bram_clk_a are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks bram_clk_a]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks bram_clk_a and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks bram_clk_a] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning

The clocks clk_fpga_0 and bram_clk_a are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks bram_clk_a]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock bram_clk_a is created on an inappropriate internal pin nlms_hw_system_i/nlms_top_0/inst/bram_clk_a. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

DPIR-1#190 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP nlms_hw_system_i/nlms_top_0/inst/DUT/nlms_datapath_INST/multipliers_INST/mul_1/prod_raw_sign_nxt_c input pin nlms_hw_system_i/nlms_top_0/inst/DUT/nlms_datapath_INST/multipliers_INST/mul_1/prod_raw_sign_nxt_c/B[7] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
